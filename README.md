# TFE_neuron-GLM
This repository countains all the codes, the figures, and the .tex files (generating figures) used in the master's thesis "Modelling and classification of neuronal dynamics through Generalised Linear Models", June 2024.

**References** <br>
The codes used to built the GLM coming from the matlab code of the Alison Weber Github page. (https://github.com/aiweber/GLM_and_Izhikevich) <br>
The CBM used in the second part (DA neuron and STG neuron) are the ones of Arthur Fyon. (Fyon, A. (2024). CORR_2024 (Version 1.0.0) [Computer software]) (https://github.com/arthur-fyon/CORR_2024) <br>

**Corrections** <br>
The Figures 3.8a and 3.8b have been udpated (the y-label). <br>
The Figure 3.7 has been updated (the "outlier" of strong bursting). <br>
